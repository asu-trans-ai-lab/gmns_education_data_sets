1. node. link
2. zone creation

based on is_boundary in node.csv
x, y, create grid 8*8 based on a certain resolution 

access_node_vector
define the mapping from zone_id to the is_boundary_nodes.

cell_code
alpha-numerical codes

production is proportional to the # of access_node vectors

internally, DTALite 

read node.
read zone
zone_id. access_node_vector
building the mapping from zone to activity nodes
